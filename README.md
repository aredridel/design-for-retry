I gave this talk at Nodevember in Nashville, Tennessee, and at Oneshot Nodeconf in Budapest, Hungary.

[PDF copies of the slides](https://github.com/aredridel/design-for-retry/releases) are available.  If you want the speaker notes, read [the markup](slides.md).

The Nodevember talk was recorded and [placed on YouTube](http://youtube.com/watch?v=LpbdQpF9_40). Watch it!
